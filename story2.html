                <h4  style="margin-left: 4%"> A <u class="r1">null</u> was making anywhere fun of the null one day for <br> being so slow.<br>

                "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with  a mocking laugh,<br>
           <u class="r8"> Yes</u> replied the <u class="r2">null.</u>"but I get there <u class="r7">null</u> than they think.I'll runn you a race and proved it.*<br>


        the <u class="r1">null</u> was much <u class="r4">null</u> at the idea of the running a race <br>with the <u class="r2"> null</u>,but for thr fun of the thing he<br> agrred.So the <u class="r3">null</u>, who had consented to act as <br>juadge,marked the distance yellled,<u>"null"</u>.<br>

        The <u class="r1">null</u> was soon far out of sight, and to make<br> the <u class="r2">null</u> feelvery deeply how ridiculous it was for<br> him to try a race with a <u class="r1">null</u>,he went off the course <br> to practice <u class="r5">null</u> for <u class="r6"> null</u> hours untill the <u class="r2">null</u> should
               catch up.<br><br> 

        The <u class="r2"> null</u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily,<br>
        and,after a time,passed the place where the place where the <u class="r1">null</u> <br>
        was <u class="r5"> null </u>.The <u class="r1">null</u> was so caught up in <u class="r5">null</u>;and <br>when at lasthe did stop, the  <u class="r2"> null</u> was near the
        goal.The<u class="r1"> null</u> now ran his swiftest,but he could<br>
        not overtake the <u class="r2">null</u> in time.
